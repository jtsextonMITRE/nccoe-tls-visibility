**DISCLAIMER**

Certain commercial entities, equipment, products, or materials may be identified by name or company logo or other insignia in order to acknowledge their participation in this collaboration or to describe an experimental procedure or concept adequately. Such identification is not intended to imply special status or relationship with NIST or recommendation or endorsement by NIST or NCCoE; neither is it intended to imply that the entities, equipment, products, or materials are necessarily the best available for the purpose.

While NIST and the NCCoE address goals of improving management of cybersecurity and privacy risk through outreach and application of standards and best practices, it is the stakeholder's responsibility to fully perform a risk assessment to include the current threat, vulnerabilities, likelihood of a compromise, and the impact should the threat be realized before adopting cybersecurity measures such as this recommendation.

**NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY CENTER OF EXCELLENCE**

The National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE), a part of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), is a collaborative hub where industry organizations, government agencies, and academic institutions work together to address businesses ' most pressing cybersecurity issues. This public-private partnership enables the creation of practical cybersecurity solutions for specific industries, as well as for broad, cross-sector technology challenges. Through consortia under Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs), including technology partners—from Fortune 50 market leaders to smaller companies specializing in information technology security—the NCCoE applies standards and best practices to develop modular, adaptable example cybersecurity solutions using commercially available technology. The NCCoE documents these example solutions in the NIST Special Publication 1800 series, which maps capabilities to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and details the steps needed for another entity to re-create the example solution. The NCCoE was established in 2012 by NIST in partnership with the State of Maryland and Montgomery County, Maryland.

**NIST CYBERSECURITY PRACTICE GUIDES**

NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guides (Special Publication 1800 series) target specific cybersecurity challenges in the public and private sectors. They are practical, user-friendly guides that facilitate the adoption of standards-based approaches to cybersecurity. They show members of the information security community how to implement example solutions that help them align with relevant standards and best practices, and provide users with the materials lists, configuration files, and other information they need to implement a similar approach.

The documents in this series describe example implementations of cybersecurity practices that businesses and other organizations may voluntarily adopt. These documents do not describe regulations or mandatory practices, nor do they carry statutory authority.

**ABSTRACT**

The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol is widely deployed to secure network traffic. The latest version, TLS 1.3, has been strengthened so that even if a TLS-enabled server is compromised, the contents of its previous TLS communications are still protected—better known as forward secrecy. The approach used to achieve forward secrecy interferes with passive decryption techniques that are widely used by enterprises to achieve visibility into their own TLS 1.2 traffic. Many enterprises depend on that visibility to permit their authorized network security staff to implement controls needed to conform to cybersecurity, operational, and regulatory requirements. This forces enterprises to choose between using the old TLS 1.2 protocol or adopting TLS 1.3 with some alternative method for internal traffic visibility. The NCCoE has, in collaboration with technology providers and enterprise customers, initiated a project demonstrating options for maintaining visibility within the TLS 1.3 protocol within an enterprise to overcome these impediments. The project demonstrates several standards-compliant builds that can be used within enterprises to provide both real-time and post-facto systems monitoring and analytics capabilities. This publication describes the motivation, approach, architecture, build implementation, demonstration scenarios, results, and risk and compliance management characteristics for the demonstrated proofs of concept. Links to detailed technical information on implementation of each build resident on GitHub can serve as a valuable resource for your technology implementers by providing models they can emulate. The lessons learned from the implementations and integrations can benefit your organization by saving time and resources. This guide also includes links to mappings of TLS 1.3 visibility principles to commonly used security standards and guidance.

**CALL FOR PATENT CLAIMS**

This public review includes a call for information on essential patent claims (claims whose use would be required for compliance with the guidance or requirements in this Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) draft publication). Such guidance and/or requirements may be directly stated in this ITL Publication or by reference to another publication. This call also includes disclosure, where known, of the existence of pending U.S. or foreign patent applications relating to this ITL draft publication and of any relevant unexpired U.S. or foreign patents.

ITL may require from the patent holder, or a party authorized to make assurances on its behalf, in written or electronic form, either:

a) assurance in the form of a general disclaimer to the effect that such party does not hold and does not currently intend holding any essential patent claim(s); or

b) assurance that a license to such essential patent claim(s) will be made available to applicants desiring to utilize the license for the purpose of complying with the guidance or requirements in this ITL draft publication either:

   1. under reasonable terms and conditions that are demonstrably free of any unfair discrimination; or 

   2. without compensation and under reasonable terms and conditions that are demonstrably free of any unfair discrimination. 

Such assurance shall indicate that the patent holder (or third party authorized to make assurances on its behalf) will include in any documents transferring ownership of patents subject to the assurance, provisions sufficient to ensure that the commitments in the assurance are binding on the transferee, and that the transferee will similarly include appropriate provisions in the event of future transfers with the goal of binding each successor-in-interest. 

The assurance shall also indicate that it is intended to be binding on successors-in-interest regardless of whether such provisions are included in the relevant transfer documents. 

Such statements should be addressed to: applied-crypto-visibility@nist.gov
