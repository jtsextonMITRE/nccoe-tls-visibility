Not for Radio
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since 2013, **Not for Radio** (NFR) has provided solutions to complex
challenges in communication networks for both corporate and government
customers, with deployments in internet and telecommunication
infrastructure as well as high-performance computing fabrics. NFR's
contribution to the project is its Encryption Visibility
Architecture\ :sup:`TM` (EVA\ :sup:`TM`) product, which offers a
flexible software solution for maintaining data visibility in enterprise
networks following the deployment of TLS 1.3 while supporting additional
protocols such as legacy TLS and IPsec.

EVA is designed to be minimally intrusive with respect to the diversity
of existing security postures, compliance regimes, performance
requirements, and orchestration technologies typically found in service
operator environments. The demonstration systems constructed for this
project employ NFR's Encryption Visibility Agent\ :sup:`TM`
(EVA\ :sup:`TM`) in its Bounded Lifetime Key Control mode, with an
external key management system configured as the source of the
bounded-lifetime key material. With this configuration, the Agent runs
within the applications of interest and enforces the use of the
controlled, bounded-lifetime Diffie-Hellman key material in TLS 1.3
sessions. Importantly, the Agent's operation does not introduce new
pathways for the lateral movement of malware by requiring the relaxation
of any platform security mechanisms. Other modes of operation of the
EVA, such as high performance and fully deterministic reporting of
per-session key material, as well as distributed bounded-lifetime key
generation, are not used in this demonstration. Additional components of
the Encryption Visibility Architecture\ :sup:`TM` family designed to
address scalability and integration challenges within larger deployments
are likewise not used.

Thales Trusted Cyber Technologies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Thales Trusted Cyber Technologies** is a U.S. provider of
cybersecurity solutions dedicated to the U.S. Government. It protects
data from the core to the cloud to the edge with a unified approach to
data protection. Thales' solutions reduce the risks associated with
critical attack vectors and address stringent encryption, key
management, and access control requirements. In addition to the core
solutions developed and manufactured in the U.S. specifically for the
Federal Government, Thales sells and supports third-party,
commercial-off-the-shelf solutions. To mitigate the risks associated
with procuring data security solutions developed outside of the U.S,
Thales operates under a Proxy Agreement with the Defense
Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) for Foreign Ownership,
Control, or Influence (FOCI) and Committee on Foreign Investments in the
United States (CFIUS) National Security Agreement.

For this project, Thales contributed its hardware security module (HSM), a dedicated
cryptographic processor that is specifically designed for the protection of the
crypto key lifecycle. The HSM acts as a trust anchor that protects the
cryptographic infrastructures by securely managing, processing, and
storing cryptographic keys inside a hardened, tamper-resistant device.
Thales HSMs always store cryptographic keys in hardware. They provide a
secure crypto foundation, as the keys never leave the
intrusion-resistant, tamper-evident, `FIPS
140-validated <https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/validated-modules/search?SearchMode=Basic&Vendor=Thales&CertificateStatus=Active&ValidationYear=0>`__
appliance. Since all cryptographic operations occur within the HSM,
strong access controls prevent unauthorized users from accessing
sensitive cryptographic material. Thales also implements operations that
make the deployment of secure HSMs as easy as possible. They are
integrated with the Thales Crypto Command Center for quick and easy
crypto resource partitioning, reporting, and monitoring. Learn more about

Architecture and Builds
-----------------------

Some aspects of the analytics functions requiring enterprise visibility
into its encrypted TLS 1.3 traffic may consider combining network
architecture and key-management techniques to achieve operational
visibility. These functions may include:

- identifying the causes of network performance degradation or failures

- key management-based communications failures

- detection and identification of anomalous received data

- identification of sources of anomalous data

- detection of encrypted traffic from unauthorized sources

- extraction of enterprise data to anomalous destinations.

This project aims to develop and test an architecture that provides
visibility within an enterprise data center. This is achieved using
tools that intercept and decrypt traffic without altering the traffic
flow between the TLS clients and servers, all without changing the TLS
1.3 protocol. In this demonstration project, we examine TLS 1.3
deployment *within* the enterprise data center and address mechanisms
that can support access to historical data by leveraging key
management-based and middlebox solutions.

This NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guide addresses the challenge of
maintaining visibility into network traffic encrypted with TLS 1.3
within enterprise data centers. It focuses on securely managing servers'
cryptographic keys, recorded traffic, and privacy expectations. Our
builds demonstrate real-time decryption, analysis, or post facto
decryption and TLS 1.3 encrypted traffic described by one of the following:

- Bounded-lifetime DH keys on the TLS server

- Export of TLS session keys from the TLS server

- Break and inspection of TLS traffic using a middlebox

-	Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Data Link Layer 2 cryptography

- OSI Network Layer 3 cryptography

System Architecture Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below are the components that comprise the TLS 1.3 visibility
architecture.

- **Server Components**: Handle services like HTTPS and email, manage
  network resources, generate session keys, negotiate encryption
  protocols, and integrate with key management infrastructure.

- **Client Components**: Initiate encrypted traffic for users, devices,
  and processes that interact with servers to request certificates and
  keys. They are typically located outside of data centers.

- **Network Tap Function**: Copies network traffic for logging and
  monitoring, aiding in the detection of malicious activity or security
  threats.

- **Break and Inspect Middlebox**: Decrypts, inspects, and re-encrypts
  traffic to identify threats before the data is transmitted into or out
  of the network.

- **Real-Time Decryption**: Decrypts and forwards traffic with minimal
  delay to support real-time security needs.

- **Real-Time Analytics**: Processes data quickly for immediate threat
  detection and response, providing insights on network performance and
  potential anomalies.

- **Post-Facto Decryption and Analytics**: Decrypts and stores encrypted
  data for later analysis, such as forensic investigations, ensuring
  secure handling, and disposal of data.

- **Key Management Agent**: Provides a secure interface for provisioning
  TLS server keys and implementing policies for key activation and
  expiration.

- **Key Capture and Registration Agent:** Captures the session keys at
  the time they are generated and registers the session keys with the
  Key Governance Platform.

- **Enterprise PKI**: Manages digital certificates and validates
  identities, binding them to cryptographic keys for secure
  communication.

- **Key Governance**: Oversees the lifecycle of certificates and keys,
  including issuance, renewal, revocation, and secure storage.

- **Key Source**: A secure, FIPS 140-validated component that generates
  cryptographic keys for use within the TLS 1.3 project.



High-Level Passive Inspection Architecture Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The figures below depict the functional components of a passive decrypt
and inspect demonstration architecture. The figure below depicts
passive inspection using rotated bounded-lifetime DH keys on the
destination TLS server. This approach can be used to capture decrypted
traffic for real-time analysis, incoming traffic for post-facto or
historical analysis, or both. Note that the clients internal to the
enterprise receiving TLS 1.3-protected traffic from the
TLS server are not depicted.

   Passive Inspection Functional Architecture - Bounded-Lifetime DH

The figure below depicts passive decryption and inspection using exported
session keys. The architecture permits real-time analysis of decrypted
TLS traffic and post-facto analysis of stored encrypted traffic. Note:
Exported session keys can be used to decrypt TLS traffic irrespective of
the session's TLS version and cipher suite. In addition to exporting the
session keys, the Key Management Agent also exports the Client Random
from the TLS handshake to allow real-time and post-facto decryption
devices to match session keys to network flows.

   :alt: A depiction of the components listed immediately below the figure.
   :width: 90%

   Passive Inspection - Exported Session Key Functional Architecture

The function of each component used for passive inspection is described
as follows:

- **TLS Client Devices:** Devices that initiate encrypted traffic.

- **Network Tap:** Component that provides a copy of traffic from a
  network segment.

- **Real-Time Decryption:** Passive decrypt component that decrypts and
  forwards the copied traffic.

- **Real-Time Analytics Platform:** Set of tools for examining decrypted
  payloads to identify undesired characteristics.

- **Traffic Capture Platform:** Encrypted storage of captured traffic to
  allow subsequent analytics of captured traffic. This can be encrypted
  storage of captured decrypted traffic or storage of the captured
  original encrypted traffic.

- **Key Governance Platform:** Security module performing storage and
  distribution of keys (e.g., discover, create, renew, provision,
  revoke, and destroy certificates and keys). Bounded-lifetime DH keys
  are pushed to the TLS server and passive decrypt device to provide
  real-time decryption. They are also stored for future use by decrypt
  solutions that work with captured encrypted sessions. Exported session
  keys and flow identification data are obtained from the Session Key
  Capture agent or the decrypt platform. These keys enable real-time
  decryption and are stored for future use by decryption solutions that
  handle captured encrypted sessions.

- **TLS Server:** Counterparty for encrypted traffic that generates session
  keys, negotiates encryption protocols, and connects to key management
  infrastructure.

- **Bounded-Lifetime DH Key Management Agent:** Receives the
  bounded-lifetime keys from the key governance platform and enables
  their use by the TLS server according to key governance platform
  policy.

- **Key Capture and Registration Agent:** Captures the session keys at
  the time they are generated and registers the session keys with the
  Key Governance Platform and the passive real-time decryptor.

- **Enterprise Public Key Infrastructure:** CA that provides enterprise
  public key certificates.

**Note**: Information transfers within an enterprise and any information
stored on/by the analytics platform require cryptographic protection or
compensating physical controls.

High-Level Middlebox Architecture Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To achieve necessary visibility into encrypted TLS 1.3 traffic, some
enterprise analytics functions may require a middlebox architecture that
integrates network and key-management techniques. These functions may
include identifying network performance issues, managing key-based
communication failures, and detecting anomalous data sources or
unauthorized encrypted traffic. The project scope includes a
demonstration of middleboxes within the data center that "break and
inspect" traffic for real-time analysis, commonly deployed at the
enterprise edge. The figure below illustrates the components of the Break and
Inspect (B&I) architecture used in this demonstration.

.. figure:: /images/figures/Figure-1-3_v4.png
   :alt: A depiction of the process flow for the components listed immediately below the figure.
   :width: 90%

   Middlebox (Break and Inspect) Functional Architecture

Below are descriptions of the B&I middlebox components:

- **TLS Client Devices:** These devices initiate encrypted traffic and
  may reside outside the data center. However, B&I is not using
  bounded-lifetime DH or ephemeral key reporting to gain visibility. As
  such, the TLS 1.3 sessions from both an external client to the B&I
  device and from the B&I device to the server have forward secrecy.

- **Break and Inspect Component:** Component that terminates, decrypts,
  and re-encrypts/reinitiates TLS traffic.

- **Real-Time Analytics Platform:** Set of tools that examine
  unencrypted payloads to identify undesired characteristics.

- **Traffic Capture Platform:** Encrypted storage of captured decrypted
  traffic or storage of the captured original encrypted traffic that
  enables subsequent analytics of captured traffic.

- **Key Governance Platform:** Security module performing storage and
  distribution of ephemeral session keys and associated flow
  identification data provided by the B&I device for later use by a
  passive decrypt device working on captured encrypted traffic.

- **TLS Server:** Counterparty for encrypted traffic that generates
  session keys, negotiates encryption protocols, and connects to the
  enterprise PKI infrastructure.

- **Enterprise PKI:** CA that provides enterprise key certificates.

  Note: Information transfers within the enterprise and any information
  stored on or by the analytics platform require cryptographic
  protection or compensating physical controls. Also, in the example
  above, the B&I device feeds analytics tools with a copy of the
  decrypted TLS traffic (i.e., the analytic tool is passive and consumes
  the feed). B&I devices are capable of feeding the decrypted TLS
  traffic to inline security tools, which may modify the decrypted
  traffic before returning it to the B&I device for re-encryption and
  forwarding it to the final destination. In the use case above, with
  passive analytic tools, the end-to-end payload between client and
  server is unmodified, whereas the use of inline tools may result in
  modification.
